Ben Hazlett

Overview:
My solution is implemented in Python 3 (specifically 3.3.2)

There are three files of code submitted:

<h1>AutocompleteProvider.py</h1>
Contains the implementation of the AutocompleteProvider class which has the following functions

quicksort()
train()
putInDict()
getWords()
dump()

Candidate.py
Contains the implementation of the Candidate class which has the following functions

getConfidence()
getWord()
increaseConfidenceByOne()
stringify()

testOne.py
File that tests the classes implemented in the other two files. Expects input from the user to get the file to input and the fragment to input.

testTwo.py
File that tests a user choice of inputs from the user then demonstrates the difference between in the suggested words.

Running my Solution:
To run this all that is required is Python 3 (default).
To test it
