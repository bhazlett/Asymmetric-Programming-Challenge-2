<h1>Asymmetric Programming Challenge 2</h1>
<h2>Mobile Device Keyboard</h2>
Ben Hazlett

<h2>Overview:</h2>
My solution is implemented in Python 3 (specifically 3.3.2)

There are three files of code submitted:

<h3>AutocompleteProvider.py</h3>
Contains the implementation of the AutocompleteProvider class which has the following functions

quicksort()
train()
putInDict()
getWords()
dump()

<h3>Candidate.py</h3>
Contains the implementation of the Candidate class which has the following functions

getConfidence()
getWord()
increaseConfidenceByOne()
stringify()

<h3>testOne.py</h3>
File that tests the classes implemented in the other two files. Expects input from the user to get the file to input and the fragment to input.

<h3>testTwo.py</h3>
File that tests a user choice of inputs from the user then demonstrates the difference between in the suggested words.

<h2>Running my Solution:</h3>
To run this all that is required is Python 3 (default).
To test it
